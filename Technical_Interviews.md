# Technical Interviews
There is a plethora of online resources that you can take advantage of to learn almost anything. With enough willpower and time, you can jump into an unfamiliar subject and get guidance from the best teachers out there. I've compiled a list of online learning platforms that I'm familiar with. Most offer all free courses. Others have free courses, and give more personalized attention for a fee. Some are paid subscription services with a few trial courses. The paid ones are sometimes worth the money, but be sure to do your due diligence if you want to go that route. Here is the list:

### Books
* [Cracking the Coding Interview] by Gayle Laakmann McDowell (*earlier editions are good as well*)
* [Cracking the Tech Career] by Gayle Laakmann McDowell (*an expansion of [The Google Resume]*)

McDowell (the author of the *Cracking the...* franchise and founder of CareerCup) sells a set of [unscripted 
technical interview videos] that are absolutely invaluable to getting yourself prepared. A ton of her lectures 
are also posted online, and they are pretty helpful reference resources. This list is not exhaustive of course!
